    <h1>What is an HTML Element?</h1>
    <p>When it comes to HTML elements, these are the building blocks of this language. Each element is an
      individual component on a particular web page or document. They are in every part of the page,
      including the header, footer, body, and text.
      The format of a tag is a start tag followed by the content and an end tag, eventually. For instance, if
      you need to use a paragraph element, here is the way to go.

      <h1>What is an HTML Tag?</h1>
      <p>HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. There is usually an
        opening bracket followed by the elementâ€™s name and, finally, a closing bracket.
        In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element. Nevertheless, that is
        not the case for all elements.
        As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. The first one is the start tag. It contains
        two opposite angle brackets. Examples include:
        <ol>
          <li><a href="#"> Title</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Paragraph</a></li>
          <li><a href="#">Bracket</a></li>
         </ol>
     </p>
